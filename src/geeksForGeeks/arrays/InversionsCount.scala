/**
 * Inversion Count for an array indicates  how far (or close) the array is from being sorted.
 * If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0.
 * If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.
 *
 * Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j
 *
 * Example:
 * The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
